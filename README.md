# Simple Blockchain Prototype in Python

This is a lightweight, blockchain prototype built from scratch in Python. It simulates the core principles of a blockchain such as block creation, block headers,  mining (proof of work), and persistent storage using a local JSON file.

## Features

- Genesis block creation on startup
- Proof-of-work mining logic
- Block linking via previous block hash
- Simulated transactions and Merkle root hashing
- Real-time block appending
- Persistent storage using a local JSON file (no external DB)
- Code is organized into separate modules for blockchain logic, file storage, and helper functions.
